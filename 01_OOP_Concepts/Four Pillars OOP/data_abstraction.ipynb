    "Abstraction is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. This helps in reducing complexity and increases efficiency by allowing the user to interact with the system at a higher level.\n",

    "Classes and methods are used to achieve abstraction in Python. By defining abstract classes and methods, we can create a blueprint for other classes to follow, ensuring a consistent interface while hiding the underlying implementation details.\n",
