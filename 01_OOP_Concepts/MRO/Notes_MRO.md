### **1. Introduction to MRO** (15 minutes)  
#### **What is MRO?**  
- **Definition**:  
  - MRO is the order in which Python searches for methods in a class hierarchy.  
  - It ensures that the correct method is called, especially in cases of multiple inheritance.  
- **Why is MRO Important?**  
  - Resolves ambiguity in method lookup.  
  - Ensures consistency in class hierarchies.  
  - Prevents infinite loops and conflicts in inheritance.  

#### **Real-World Analogy**  
- Think of MRO as a "family tree" where Python looks for a method starting from the child class and moving up to the parent classes.  

#### **Example**:  
```python
class A:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from A")

class B(A):
    pass

class C(A):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.greet()  # What will this print?
```
- **Output**: `Hello from C`  
- **Explanation**: Python follows the MRO of `D` to resolve the `greet()` method.

### **2. How MRO Works** (25 minutes)  
#### **MRO in Single Inheritance**  
- Simple linear order: Child → Parent → Grandparent.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  class A:
      pass

  class B(A):
      pass

  class C(B):
      pass

  print(C.mro())  # Output: [C, B, A, object]
  ```

#### **MRO in Multiple Inheritance**  
- Python uses the **C3 Linearization Algorithm** to determine the order.  
- Rules:  
  1. Child class comes before parent class.  
  2. Order of inheritance matters (left-to-right).  
  3. No class should appear more than once in the MRO.  

#### **Example**:  
```python
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(A):
    pass

class D(B, C):
    pass

print(D.mro())  # Output: [D, B, C, A, object]
```

#### **Viewing MRO**  
- Use the `mro()` method or `__mro__` attribute:  
  ```python
  print(D.mro())  # or print(D.__mro__)
  ```

#### **Interactive Exercise**:  
- Ask students to predict the MRO for a given class hierarchy.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  class X:
      pass

  class Y(X):
      pass

  class Z(X):
      pass

  class A(Y, Z):
      pass

  class B(Z, Y):
      pass

  print(A.mro())
  print(B.mro())
  ```

### **3. The `super()` Function and MRO** (20 minutes)  
#### **What is `super()`?**  
- A built-in function used to call methods from a parent class.  
- Relies on MRO to determine which class’s method to call.  

#### **How `super()` Works with MRO**  
- Example:  
  ```python
  class A:
      def greet(self):
          print("Hello from A")

  class B(A):
      def greet(self):
          print("Hello from B")
          super().greet()  # Calls A's greet()

  class C(A):
      def greet(self):
          print("Hello from C")
          super().greet()  # Calls A's greet()

  class D(B, C):
      def greet(self):
          print("Hello from D")
          super().greet()  # Calls B's greet()

  d = D()
  d.greet()
  # Output:
  # Hello from D
  # Hello from B
  # Hello from C
  # Hello from A
  ```

#### **Key Points**:  
- `super()` follows the MRO to resolve method calls.  
- Ensures all classes in the hierarchy are called in the correct order.  

#### **Interactive Exercise**:  
- Modify the above example to include more classes and predict the output.

### **4. C3 Linearization Algorithm** (25 minutes)  
#### **What is C3 Linearization?**  
- The algorithm Python uses to compute the MRO.  
- Ensures consistency and avoids ambiguity in multiple inheritance.  

#### **How C3 Works**:  
- Merge operation: Combines the MROs of parent classes while preserving order.  
- Rules:  
  1. Local precedence order (left-to-right).  
  2. No class should appear before its parents.  
  3. No class should appear more than once.  

#### **Step-by-Step Calculation**:  
1. Start with the child class.  
2. Merge the MROs of its parents while preserving the order.  
3. Repeat until all classes are included.  

#### **Example**:  
```python
class X:
    pass

class Y:
    pass

class Z:
    pass

class A(X, Y):
    pass

class B(Y, Z):
    pass

class M(A, B, Z):
    pass

print(M.mro())
# Output: [M, A, X, B, Y, Z, object]
```

#### **Interactive Exercise**:  
- Provide a complex class hierarchy and ask students to compute the MRO manually.

### **5. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices** (15 minutes)  
#### **Common Mistakes**:  
- Circular inheritance (leads to `TypeError`).  
- Overcomplicating class hierarchies.  
- Ignoring the order of inheritance.  

#### **Best Practices**:  
- Use multiple inheritance sparingly.  
- Keep class hierarchies simple and shallow.  
- Always check the MRO using `mro()`.  

#### **Example of Circular Inheritance**:  
```python
class A(B):
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

# This will raise a TypeError.
```

### **6. Interactive Coding and Q&A** (30 minutes)  
#### **Coding Exercises**:  
1. Create a class hierarchy and compute its MRO.  
2. Use `super()` to demonstrate method resolution.  
3. Resolve a complex multiple inheritance scenario.  

#### **Q&A**:  
- Address student questions and clarify doubts.  
- Discuss real-world use cases of MRO.

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. MRO determines the order in which Python searches for methods in a class hierarchy.  
2. The C3 Linearization Algorithm ensures consistency in multiple inheritance.  
3. `super()` relies on MRO to call parent class methods.  
4. Always check the MRO using `mro()` or `__mro__` to avoid surprises.
